# SignUP
SignUp page as decided. Did some weird stuff with LinkedIn Developer Page (made an org -> created a linkedIN App -> added demo and non working website redirect URL -> added authentication for "connect with LinkedIn" using linkedIn API and Flask framework. I don't know if it works yet but will work on it.

Some useful info: 1) the page is not fully functional/ ready yet. Connect with UNT redirects to my.unt.edu since I don't know how the user will connect with UNT email after they have graduated?
2)Connect with LinkedIn won't work for a week until I figure out how this OAuth2.0 for linkedIn works with the API an stuff using Flask framework. 
3)Page is not connected to any database to store credentials after the user creates an account. Only message will be sent but no data will flow (obv, for now)
4)That's it for this week
